Github User Viewer
===============
Compare the repo count of mulitple users in a grid. Everytime you add a user via the user dropdown input, the user is added to the grid as a card, displaying a horizontal bar graph representing their total number of repos. The max value of the repo bar is calculated by taking the max value on the page and adding 25% percent of that. All cards have the same max value for their bar graphs at any given time.
